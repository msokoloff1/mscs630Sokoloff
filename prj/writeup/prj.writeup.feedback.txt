The project attempts to make cryptographic adversarial networks.
The idea has good merit. 

However, there are some issues...
Writeup:
- It does not follow the structure required. Abstract, Introduction, etc. -1pt

Code:
- The repository contains no code available for grading. It just links to other
  repositories for which I am not a contributor.  -5pts

Overall:
- The project is really cool. Are you interested in publishing this?
